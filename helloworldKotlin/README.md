Hello World Example Extension (in Kotlin)
============================

Build this project with `gradlew shadowJar`

###### Prints output to various locations within Burp.

This extension is about as basic as things can get, while actually
doing something.

It demonstrates the following techniques:
- Setting the name of the extension, which will be shown to the user in the UI.
- Writing messages to the output and error streams.
- Writing messages to the main Burp alerts log.
- Generating an exception to demonstrate how this is reported to the user.
